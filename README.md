# iSHARE Documentation
The documentation is built with [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx) using a [rtd theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme). The documentation is open sourced to allow the readers to directly contribute on its improvements.

# HTML Generation
First, make sure you have [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) installed. To view the generated HTML before creating a pull request run the following command in the folder where make.bat is located:

```
C:\Documentation> .\make.bat html
```

In case not all HTML updated, this could be solved by the following command:

```
C:\Documentation> .\make.bat clean
```

# Contribution
If you find anything that could be improved, feel free to create a pull request to the master branch.
